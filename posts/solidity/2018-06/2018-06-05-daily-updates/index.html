<h2 id="solidity-community-updates">Solidity Community Updates</h2>

<p>On the solidity gitter channel overnight, there was a long discussion from a new ethereum developer who&rsquo;s trying to figure out how to store images on the blockchain. Anyone who&rsquo;s spent time with this knows you don&rsquo;t want to store that much data on chain.</p>

<p>One of the community members cautioned him that &ldquo;storing an image would cost more gas than a buying a car,&rdquo; but he persisted looking for different compression libraries and kinds of stuff and kept at it with the community. Finally, he got this: &ldquo;the question doesn&rsquo;t really make sense, thats why you are not really getting good answers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One thing I liked about the exchange is that the community never really got snippy or attacked him for such a fundamental question that they&rsquo;ve surely heard dozens of times now. That&rsquo;s good.</p>

<h2 id="legal-updates">Legal updates</h2>

<p>There’s a <a href="https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=ee978b82-1eed-4c3c-a8ae-e8ccd078b462">great write up on Lexology</a> on <strong>Wyoming’s Spring blockchain legislation</strong>.</p>

<p>Also an interesting discussion of <strong>GDPR and blockchain</strong> <a href="https://www.computing.co.uk/ctg/news/3033521/companies-will-move-towards-private-blockchains-as-gdpr-gains-ground">over at Computing</a>. GDPR is hard enough to undstand but add GDPR to the mix and my head may actually explode.</p>
