<p>Happy Tuesday, blockchain engineers (and counsel)!</p>

<p>In today’s update we notice the Solidity open source dev community is busy, I invite you to join me at the first LA Smart Contract Meetup, and Jimmy Wales says blockchain can’t be banned. <strong>But he’s wrong.</strong></p>

<h2 id="some-solidity-updates-for-your-tuesday">Some Solidity updates for your Tuesday</h2>

<p>There&rsquo;s an updated or <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/truffle-migrations-explained/">refreshed guide on Truffle migrations</a> on Sitepoint, which is kind of helpful. Speaking candidly, my <code>truffle migrate</code> command has been failing me of late. Maybe this guide, which I think I&rsquo;ve worked with before, will help me out. And you too.</p>

<p>The Solidity developers are hard at work - 25 commits today alone.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4262">some extended discussion</a> about how to target EVM versions in syntax tests, which I wonder is becoming more important with the new changes being planned (e.g., Casper). Of note, one of the commenters reminds that you can target a version with <code>soltest --evm-version</code>.</p>

<p>Also, a plug for my upcoming the first <a href="https://www.meetup.com/LA-Smart-Contract-Meetup/events/251541758/">LA Smart Contract Meetup conference call</a>. Free for anyone to join. If you want the bridge number but don&rsquo;t want to register for Meetup drop me a note (email coming up below).</p>

<p><strong>Hey let me know</strong> if you&rsquo;re out there and struggling with Truffle migrate too or looking forward to 0.5.0 (or not) or wanna listen in on my lunch update call:  <a href="mailto:michael@michaelricelaw.com">michael@michaelricelaw.com</a>.</p>

<h2 id="surfing-the-web-web1-not-web2-and-certainly-not-web3">Surfing the web (web1, not web2, and certainly not web3)</h2>

<p><a href="https://apla.io">Apla</a> issued a press release on something kind of baffling to me. They&rsquo;re promoting <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/apla-offers-smart-laws-as-a-solution-for-transaction-fidelity-in-blockchains-300664739.html">something they call &ldquo;smart laws,&rdquo;</a> which seem to be different from smart contracts in that they&rsquo;re mutable in some way &ndash; able to respond to technical or even policy flaws in the original deployments. <strong>Kind of interesting but seems to open a can of worms to me</strong>. If you know more about what they&rsquo;re doing or planning, please let me know.</p>

<p>An article on CCN cites a study by a YouTube guy (see how I&rsquo;m qualifying its veracity there) <a href="https://www.ccn.com/94-out-of-top-100-blockchain-projects-are-built-on-ethereum/">saying</a> that &ldquo;the Ethereum community already has more than 250,000 developers and <strong>94 out of the top 100 blockchain projects</strong> have launched on top of the Ethereum network.&rdquo; Whatever the true numbers are, I thought that was an interesting statistic to share with your friends.</p>

<h2 id="legal-updates">Legal Updates</h2>

<p>In the <strong>Ripple litigation</strong>, Mary Jo White, the former (tough!) SEC commissioner, was officially admitted <em>pro hac</em> and the plaintiff agreed to give Ripple until June 22 to file an answer; however, they&rsquo;ll probably extend that further. The plaintiff is planning to file a motion to send back to state court, as I expected.</p>

<p>Malta&rsquo;s making a name for itself in the ICO space and <a href="http://www.mondaq.com/x/709388/fin+tech/Snapshot+Summary+Of+Three+Bills+Related+to+Blockchain+Technology">this Mondaq article</a> has a decent, if brief, analysis of some of the pending legislation over there across the pond.</p>

<p>Jimmy Wales <a href="https://ethereumworldnews.com/jimmy-wales-cant-ban-blockchain/">said recently</a>, &ldquo;you <strong>can&rsquo;t ban blockchain</strong> because it&rsquo;s math&rdquo; (I&rsquo;m paraphrasing). That&rsquo;s absurd. Of course a government can. Don’t take word for it, read Prof. Wright’s <em>Blockchain and the Law</em>.</p>

<p>While governments <em>should</em> regulate  is a whole &lsquo;nother question and the article a short read with some interesting points from Wales.</p>

<p>That’s all I’ve got for you today. See you tomorrow.</p>
