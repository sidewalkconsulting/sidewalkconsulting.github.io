      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re keeping it short but keeping it real in today&amp;rsquo;s update. A
Solidity Community Updates Short and somewhat cursory write up on a lottery smart contract, but it uses an oracle for random numbers which might be interesting to some of you all http://jacksonng.org/Lottery-Contract-2
Not really Solidity related, but closely related to the ecosystem, I noticed that the last commit in the web3 develop repo was May 17 and, it seems like there&amp;rsquo;s only been light activity in 2018.</description>

      <description>Happy Tuesday, blockchain engineers (and counsel)!
In today’s update we notice the Solidity open source dev community is busy, I invite you to join me at the first LA Smart Contract Meetup, and Jimmy Wales says blockchain can’t be banned. But he’s wrong.
Some Solidity updates for your Tuesday There&amp;rsquo;s an updated or refreshed guide on Truffle migrations on Sitepoint, which is kind of helpful. Speaking candidly, my truffle migrate command has been failing me of late.</description>

      <title>Coffey v. Ripple Labs - an early legal analysis</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m taking a break from our regular Solidity programming to take a close look at the securities litigation filed against Ripple Labs on May 3. Let&amp;rsquo;s look very closely at Plaintiff&amp;rsquo;s claim that XRP is a security, which exposes it to a broad array of regulatory and private legal actions.
Current Procedural Posture First, the case was filed recently (ok, back in May, but in judicial time that&amp;rsquo;s pretty recent) in California State Court as a securities class action against Ripple and its CEO.</description>

      <description>Solidity Community Updates On the solidity gitter channel overnight, there was a long discussion from a new ethereum developer who&amp;rsquo;s trying to figure out how to store images on the blockchain. Anyone who&amp;rsquo;s spent time with this knows you don&amp;rsquo;t want to store that much data on chain.
One of the community members cautioned him that &amp;ldquo;storing an image would cost more gas than a buying a car,&amp;rdquo; but he persisted looking for different compression libraries and kinds of stuff and kept at it with the community.</description>

      <description>Happy Monday Developers,
What do you have going on this week anyway? What are you excited about? Let me know &amp;ndash; michael@michaelricelaw.com!
Solidity Random Community Updates Not ready to vouch for it, but the IBM Blockchain Fundamentals course started today on Coursera. There&amp;rsquo;s still time to register I think. I just did, so I&amp;rsquo;ll try to give you some updates as I go through it. Saw it on the ethereum/tutorials on Gitter, btw.</description>

      <description>Heya Developers!
Happy Wednesday. Just a few days until we can get to our side projects this weekend&amp;hellip; how are you going going to decentralize?
Solidity community updates There&amp;rsquo;s a nice question and answer on how to make ERC20 token transfer in PHP on Stackoverflow. Apparently someone Furqan Siddiqui was kind enough to write a PHP library for it (erc20-php). Love this community.
On Github, dsys got a lot of love for the new solidity library for verifying Ethereum message multi-signatures (dsys/solidity-sigutils.</description>

      <description>Here’s your daily Solidity update&amp;hellip; &amp;hellip;May 29 edition!
Community updates Over on StackOverflow, there are a few interesting conversations going on. The first is how to efficiently look up struct values without having to loop. The thing I quite liked about one answer is how to avoid unnecessary copies of structs. I know people say &amp;ldquo;Solidity is like Javascript,&amp;rdquo; but really it&amp;rsquo;s not in my mind. There&amp;rsquo;s also an unanswered question on how to deploy a smart contract on a recently constructed Amazon Blockchain Template &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;m super curious about the answer, myself.</description>
